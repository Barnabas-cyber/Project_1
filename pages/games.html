    <h1>My Favourite Games</h1>
    <p>I mostly enjoy combat games, reason being that I am fascinated by the idea of being in a team to finish a certain
        mission and also sometimes individually, that comes with challenges.<br>
    Fantasy games fascinate me because of the super powers that the characters come with and the difficulty thereof when completing the missions.</p>
